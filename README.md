# techcloud-react-redux

Welcome to Techcloud! A Soundcloud client built with React/Redux.

##Background

What distinguishes Techcloud from other clients is that we will focus on the deeper-darker
side of electronic music.

Inspiration from this project comes from https://github.com/rwieruch/favesound-redux

This project is a demonstration of my love for Techno music. To any future employers I hope this app shows you what type of programmer I am. I believe in using the latest web methodologies and technologies.

##Technologies used

React for its use of components and modularity
Redux for state managament
Webpack for bundling and building our project, moreover use webpack-dev-server for localhost
React-hot-loader for hot reloading and see changes applied instantly.

##Design

Goals for initialization phase:
  1. Finish the stream page for users who are not logged in.
     the stream page just shows techno and tech-house
  2. Move on to the Mixes page
      Mixes will just contain radio shows
  3. Labels page ???
      What content can i put there?
        It would basically be a grid of labels. A set list of labels. try to include at least 30.

After finishing stuff for unauthed users:
Replace stream page with page similar to Soundcloud.
    1. That is show the stream for a user.
        Add a small section to go to likes.
    2. Likes page should contain list of likes and some playlists.

Maybe even before moving on to implementing stuff for authed users:
  1. Implement clicking on a song and going to song page
  2. Go to user profile of song
  3. Implement the song player
